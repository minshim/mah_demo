<p class="colophone_txt"> For First Impressions, Atmospheric Solutions created an operating system called Layout in collaboration with graphic designer Minami Shimakage. The system comprises a constantly evolving, poetic web interface, invitations distributed during performances, and an object designed to integrate the museum's archives. Playing on the homonymy of the word layout - both the graphic arrangement of information in a given space, and the tradition of preparing a body for burial - the project questions the architectures through which images become visible, legible, and the conditions under which they begin to disintegrate. Inspired by the museum as an interface for organizing memory, Layout explores the protocols of preservation, exhibition and obsolescence.   </p>

<div class="event_title" id="col-1">[1]<br>Artist: Florence Jung<br>
Date: October, 2025 to June, 2026</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>  Florence Jung infiltrates First Impressions with three scenarios unfolding over the course of a year, both within and beyond the museum.</p>
<p>Inside, for twelve months, psychostimulants and painkillers are made available to the public. Outside, from summer 2025 to summer 2026, rain falls without end before the window of a former private bank in Basel. As the artist says, everything is real.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
Florence Jung creates script-based situations, which she refers to as scenarios. In the absence of evidences, these scenarios circulate through the personal, evolving, and sometimes contradictory narratives of viewers and witnesses. Yet none of this is fictional—each scenario is real.
Her works have been featured in numerous solo exhibitions, including at the Halle für Kunst in Lüneburg, Fondation Pernod-Ricard in Paris, Centralbanken in Oslo, the Museum für Gegenwartskunst in Siegen, Helmhaus Zürich, Frac Lorraine in Metz, Kunstverein Bielefeld, Despacio in San José, and Circuit in Lausanne. She has also participated in many group exhibitions, including at Portikus in Frankfurt, Poush in Aubervilliers, Palais de Tokyo in Paris, Kunsthalle Basel, Kunsthaus Zürich, Gasworks in London, the Haubrok Foundation in Berlin, Forde in Geneva, the Estonian Museum of Contemporary Art in Tallinn, the Oscar Niemeyer Museum in Curitiba, Museum Tinguely in Basel, the Frans Hals Museum in Haarlem, and the Museum of Modern and Contemporary Art in Strasbourg. 
Florence Jung has also participated in various biennials, including Stavanger Seccession, Art Encounter, the Ural Biennale, and the Athens Biennale. Her works are held in several public collections, Swiss Federal Art Collection, Kunsthaus Aarau, Kunsthaus Zürich, Fonds d’Art Contemporain – Paris Collections, the CNAP, and several FRACs.
From 2016 to 2024, she was the co-founder and co-director of le lieu secret—an independent art space located in the train station of Biel—where she presented solo exhibitions by artists such as Walead Beshty, Jason Dodge, Judith Kakon, Olivier Mosset, Sadie Plant, Liv Schulman, etc.
A former resident of the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam and the Museum Susch, Florence Jung is the recipient of the Swiss Performance Award, the Georg and Josi Guggenheim Prize, the Swiss Art Award, the Foundation Irène Reymond Prize and the Foundation Aeschlimann Corti Hauptpreis.</p>

[2] <br><i>nine tails</i><br>
Artist: Mira Mann<br>
Date: October 16, 2025
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>   Mira Mann presents a new performance extending their film nine tails (2025), centered on the figure of Choi Seung Hee (1911–1969), North Korean dancer and choreographer, pioneer of modern dance and regarded as the first Korean dancer to pursue an international career. Known for her syncretic approach blending contemporary experimentations with traditional dances, such as Korean sword, fan, or mask dances, Choi developed her choreographic language in constant dialogue with the expectations of an entertainment industry marked by exoticization and colonial projection. After the partition of Korea, she moved to the North and became a central figure in the socialist cultural project, performing internationally within the communist bloc. Her trajectory thus embodies the tensions between cosmopolitanism, propaganda, national identity, and symbolic reappropriation.
Mira Mann’s performance unfolds through an intervention in the museum’s private presentation rooms, a screening session, and a live performance developed in collaboration with performer Paula Pau and accompanied by drummer Domi Chansorn. The performance explores choreographic borrowing as a method, the tactical adoption of representations, and the modes of circulation within cultural industries shaped by systemic and ideological biases in a gaze economy saturated with expectations. It thus addresses representations of origin as performance, their political reiterations, but also their subversion for revolutionary purposes.</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>  Né·e en Allemagne, Mira Mann vit et travaille entre Paris et Düsseldorf. Alliant performance, image en mouvement, scénographie et objets, son travail explore les notions d’hybridité, de représentation et de mémoire. L’artiste s’interroge sur les processus de canonisation et d’instrumentalisation des récits historiques, ainsi que sur leur potentiel de réappropriation. Cette réflexion se développe à travers une exploration de la construction et de la déconstruction du soi, une mise en tension entre objet et sujet, ainsi qu’une perturbation des rapports de pouvoir liés à la race, à la classe et au genre, notamment par le biais du jeu et de l’appropriation.</p>
<p>  Domi Chansorn received his first scholarship as a drummer in New York City at the age of 14 and has since devoted himself professionally to the search for the unknown and spiritual as an instrumentalist, composer and producer Paula Paul</p>

[3] <br><i>The Tangente’s Grief </i> <br>
Artist: Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi and Fabrian Saul <br>
Date: Novembre 29, 2025 
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Three questions concerning matrices, belief, and mourning guide this collective reading by artists Fabian Saul and Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi, and curator Jade Meili Barget. Based on a system of poetic inquiry the trio developed together in 2022, the project unfolds as a landscape of text, sound, and moving image; an exploratory terrain through which the questions are examined and unsettled.
The outcome is a new film composed of found and original footage edited by Nguyen-Chi and mixed by Andrew Yong Hoon Lee; a live sonic composition by Saul; and original texts written and read by the artists and curator.
This event is presented in partnership with Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst and Zürich liest 2025.
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Fabian Saul is an author, composer, and musician. His compositions span multiple formats, including the audio series Schlechte Wörter and Stoff aus Luft. He is also the editor-in-chief of Flaneur, a magazine that dedicates each issue to a single street in the world. His recent novel Die Trauer der Tangente was published in 2024 with Matthes & Seitz. His work has received numerous accolades, including the Alfred Döblin Medal, the Roger Willemsen Foundation Fellowship, and the Harald Gerlach Fellowship.</p>
<p>
Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi is an artist whose practice mutates in and out of film, sculpture, installation, performance, and interdisciplinary research. Collaborating with characters in search of consciousness, language, and freedom, her recent work explores the aesthetic, political, and epistemological possibilities of image and sound. </p>
<p>Nguyen-Chi's work has been presented in art and cinema contexts, including Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin; Villa Medici, Rome; Whitechapel Gallery, London; Copenhagen International Documentary Festival; New York Film Festival; and Singapore International Film Festival. Forthcoming exhibitions include Carpenter Center at Harvard University, Cambridge; Experimental Media and Performing Arts Center, New York; and Göteborg International Biennial for Contemporary Art. In 2023, Nguyen-Chi was awarded the Golden Lola and Jury Grand Prix for the film Into The Violet Belly. She is currently a PhD researcher at the University of Westminster.  </p>

[4] <br><i>POSER</i> <br>
Artist: Reece Cox<br>
Date: December 5, 2025   
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>POSER is a band that doesn’t exist. Recreated anew for each performance, it is artist Reece Cox’s ongoing project exploring performativity, authenticity, and image-making within today’s cultural economy. Conceived as an image, each performance is designed as much for the audience’s phone cameras and the audiences beyond them, as for those physically present in the museum.
In this iteration, Cox draws on the trope of country music and its lost histories, flattened or erased as the genre moved through media, the recording industry’s commercial imperatives, consumerism, and political agendas. 
</p>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
Reece Cox is an artist, musician, and writer based in Berlin. His project Poser is a fictional music group without fixed members. By adopting and simultaneously deconstructing the band as a readymade cultural form, Poser serves primarily as a vehicle for producing images and live performances that challenge and contaminate notions such as artistic authenticity, experimentation, and performativity. In recent years, Poser has appeared at Sara’s, New York, KW, and Roter Salon der Volksbühne, amongst others. Beyond Poser, Cox has performed and exhibited solo and collaboratively at Magenta Plains (New York); Neue Galerie Gladbeck (Gladbeck) ; House (Berlin); September Sessions (Stockholm); Shahin Zarinbal (Berlin); Sara’s (New York); Gisela Capitain (Cologne); and others.
