Note on October 1, 2025
</div>
<p class="colophone_txt"> For First Impressions, Atmospheric Solutions created an operating system called Layout in collaboration with graphic designer Minami Shimakage. The system comprises a constantly evolving, poetic web interface, invitations distributed during performances, and an object designed to integrate the museum's archives. Playing on the homonymy of the word layout - both the graphic arrangement of information in a given space, and the tradition of preparing a body for burial - the project questions the architectures through which images become visible, legible, and the conditions under which they begin to disintegrate. Inspired by the museum as an interface for organizing memory, Layout explores the protocols of preservation, exhibition and obsolescence.   </p>

  <i>Correspondances</i><br>
  Artist: Mira Mann, with Paula Pau, Domi Chansorn<br>
  Date: October 16, 2025</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
    <i>Correspondances</i> is a new performance by Mira Mann, inspired by Choi Seung Hee (1911–1969), a pioneer of modern dance in North Korea and regarded as the first Korean dancer to pursue an international career. Mira Mann revisits the way Choi’s work was woven through borrowings from inter-Asian folk traditions, highlighting a search for anchors within the continent, at the heart of an Asia reshaped by imperial powers. In this reading, Mira also reveals folklore as a possible refuge for queer expression and gender bending. </p>
    <p>
  If <i>Correspondances</i> reclaims Asia and folklore as method, the performance also exposes their double edge: for Choi Seung Hee, this approach was an instrument of adaptation, a way of slipping through the meshes of an exoticizing industry by replaying—and perhaps sometimes, undoing—colonial projections.</p>
  <p>
  Conceived as a three-voiced dialogue with performer Paula Pau and drummer Domi Chansorn, Correspondances draws on a choreography by Choi rooted in the traditional Korean martial dance of knife and fan. This element—the fan—unfolds in the piece beyond choreographic citation, through a presentation of revolutionary 18th-century fans from the collection of the Musée d’Art et d’Histoire. Transformed into portable panoramas, these fans appear here as both support of political expression and instruments of concealment and revelation—in other words, as stagings of the self.</p>
  <div>&nbsp;</div>
  <p>
  Born in Germany, Mira Mann lives and works between Paris and Düsseldorf. Combining performance, moving image, scenography and objects, the artist's work explores notions of hybridity, representation and memory. Mann questions the processes of canonization and instrumentalization of historical narratives, as well as their potential for reappropriation. This reflection develops through an exploration of the construction and deconstruction of the self, a tension between object and subject, and a disruption of power relations linked to race, class and gender, notably through play and appropriation.

[2] <br><i>Jung99, Jung103, Jung104</i><br>
Artist: Florence Jung<br>
Date: October to June, 2026 
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>Florence Jung infiltrates <i>First Impressions</i> with three scenarios unfolding over the course of the year, within and beyond the museum.
    <p>
    Inside the museum, for twelve months, psychostimulants and painkillers are made available to the public. Outside, from summer 2025 to summer 2026, rain falls endlessly in front of the window of a former private bank in Basel. Neither fully inside nor fully outside, an element appears once a month on a Thursday, without being named.</p>
    <p>
    As the artist says, everything is real.</p>
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <p>
    Florence Jung creates situations based on scripts, which she calls scenarios. In the absence of tangible evidence, these scenarios circulate through the personal, evolving and sometimes contradictory accounts of viewers and witnesses. Yet none of this is fictional - every scenario is real. Her work has been shown in numerous international institutions, including Palais de Tokyo (Paris), Kunsthalle Basel, Gasworks (London), Portikus (Frankfurt), Kunsthaus Zürich, Museum Tinguely (Basel), Frac Lorraine (Metz), and the Musée d'art moderne et contemporain de Strasbourg. She has taken part in several biennials, including those in Athens, the Urals and Stavanger. Florence Jung has received the Swiss Art Award, the Swiss Performance Award, the Georg and Josi Guggenheim Prize and the Prix de la Fondation Aeschlimann Corti.</p>

[3] <br><i>They breathe, the celestials</i> <br>
Artist: Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi, Fabian Saul, Andrew Yong Hoon Lee<br>
Date: Novembre 27, 2025
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>The relations between image, war, and mourning guide this collective reading by artists Fabian Saul, Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi and Andrew Yong Hoon Lee, accompanied by curator Jade Meili Barget. Based on a system of poetic inquiry developed together in 2022, the project unfolds as a landscape of text, sound, and moving image; an exploratory terrain through which the relations are examined and unsettled.
    <p>
    This event is part of a three-part cycle also taking place at the Harvard Film Archive and the Migros Museum für Gegenwartskunst, in partnership with Zürich liest 2025.
    
    <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <p>
      Fabian Saul is an author, composer, and musician. His compositions span multiple formats, including the audio series Schlechte Wörter and Stoff aus Luft. He is also the editor-in-chief of Flaneur, a magazine that dedicates each issue to a single street in the world. His recent novel Die Trauer der Tangente was published in 2024 with Matthes & Seitz. His work has received numerous accolades, including the Alfred Döblin Medal, the Roger Willemsen Foundation Fellowship, and the Harald Gerlach Fellowship.
    </p>
    <p>
    Thuy-Han Nguyen-Chi is an artist whose practice mutates in and out of film, sculpture, installation, performance, and interdisciplinary research. Collaborating with characters in search of consciousness, language, and freedom, her recent work explores the aesthetic, political, and epistemological possibilities of image and sound. Nguyen-Chi's work has been presented in art and cinema contexts, including Hamburger Bahnhof, Berlin; Villa Medici, Rome; Whitechapel Gallery, London; Copenhagen International Documentary Festival; New York Film Festival; and Singapore International Film Festival. In 2023, Nguyen-Chi was awarded the Golden Lola and Jury Grand Prix for the film Into The Violet Belly. She is currently a PhD researcher at the University of Westminster. </p>
    <p>
    Andrew Yong Hoon Lee is an artist working with performance, music, sound, video, drawing and text, exploring themes of memory, movement and distance. His work often culminates into installations where relationships between media and sensory perception operate as a field with objects, images, and sounds. Lee’s work highlights the contrasts and commonalities between location and dislocation, perception and unknowability, and visibility and legibility.

[4] <br><i>POSER</i> <br>
Artist: Reece Cox<br>
Date: December 4, 2025
</div>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
    <i>Poser</i> is a band that doesn’t exist. Recreated anew for each performance, it is artist Reece Cox’s ongoing project exploring performativity, authenticity, and image-making within today’s cultural economy. Conceived as an image, each performance is designed as much for the audience’s phone cameras and the audiences beyond them, as for those physically present in the museum.</p>

    <p>
      In this iteration, Cox draws on the trope of country music and its lost histories, flattened or erased as the genre moved through media, the recording industry’s commercial imperatives, consumerism, and political agendas. </p>
      <div>&nbsp;</div>
    <p>
      Reece Cox is an artist, musician, and writer based in Berlin. His project Poser is a fictional music group without fixed members. By adopting and simultaneously deconstructing the band as a readymade cultural form, Poser serves primarily as a vehicle for producing images and live performances that challenge and contaminate notions such as artistic authenticity, experimentation, and performativity. In recent years, Poser has appeared at Sara’s, New York, KW, and Roter Salon der Volksbühne, amongst others. Beyond Poser, Cox has performed and exhibited solo and collaboratively at Magenta Plains (New York); Neue Galerie Gladbeck (Gladbeck) ; House (Berlin); September Sessions (Stockholm); Shahin Zarinbal (Berlin); Sara’s (New York); Gisela Capitain (Cologne); and others.

[0] <i>Layout</i><br>
<div>&nbsp;</div>
<p>
Layout is a project initiated by Atmospheric Solutions and graphic designer Minami Shimakage. It serves as First impressions’ OS, or Operating Spirit: an evolving poetic web interface accompanied by invitations distributed during performances, and a physical object, designed for integration into the museum’s archives. Within this framework, INV IM 0161, an unidentified collection object with incomplete provenance, communicates and archives the performance programme. This ghostly host, only known by its inventory number, learns through imitation of its sole visitor, the conservator. INV IM 0161 meticulously archives the performance programme into a box of its own design, which will be sealed and absorbed into the museum’s storage. By treating communication and archiving as an ambiguous performance, Layout operates simultaneously as a durational online intervention, and a functional information site for First impressions. In this dual role, the work reflects on the role of communication and public relations in an institution compelled to navigate the ethics of a collection’s origins.
